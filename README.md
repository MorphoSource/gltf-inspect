# gLTF Inspect

Command line utility to export JSON information about GLTF or GLB 3D models. This is a simple utility that makes use of [glTF Transform's](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform) `inspect` function, except that it outputs inspected information in JSON format instead of a table.
